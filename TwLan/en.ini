[help_intro]
first_steps="First steps"
step_1="In the beginning you will first and foremost need one thing: Resources. The lumber station produces wood, the clay pit clay and the iron mine iron. The more you upgrade these buildings, the more they produce. In the first couple of days it is very recommended to focus on resource production."
step_2="Besides producing resources you should also try to protect your resources from plunderers. They could just assault you and steal the resources, which took you plenty of time to build up. You should do something to guard yourself against this possibility. Expanding your hiding place is one possibility. The bigger it is the more resources can be hidden, invisible to enemy troops. You should use this possibility especially when strong players are in your neighbourhood."
step_3="When you have taken care of your basic resource production, you can start trading and producing troops. In the barracks (requires headquarters of level 3) you can produce spear fighters. They are not too well suited for an attack, but they offer you the possibility to plunder the resources of very weak players."
step_4="If you prefer a little trading, you should build a market (requires headquarters level 3 and warehouse level 2). Here you can see what resources your neighbouring villages are offering for exchange and you can perhaps get rid of your own excess resources for something more valuable. Of course you can also create your own offers. But remember that with a market of level 1 you only have one merchant available."
step_5="You should also try to join a tribe or establish your own one. A tribe can protect you from enemy plundering and assure a better exchange of resources. And you might make friends, too..."

[help_late_start]
late_start="Late start"
step_1="If you are joining a world that has been going on for some time, you should adjust your strategy. Of course it is still important to secure a good resource production. And you should protect yourself from plundering by your neighbours. Construct a wall, upgrade your hiding place and produce a couple of defensive units. Sometimes a nice message to you attackers can make a big difference also. Once you have managed to increase the size of your village you can try to get some resources by plundering other players. Plundered resources will help you develop your village even faster."
step_2="There are a few major differences to the usual progress, which you usually do not perform:"
step_3="Do not make the mistake to concentrate solely on the development of your first nobleman. It may seem logical, since after all you want to rule several villages. But this is a potentially fatal mistake. Much stronger players that play for a long time in this world with will try to secure villages in your area of the map, to establish a strong second base here for the further course of the game. If you invest all your resources in buildings and a strong offence, you are easy to conquer for these players! They have the possibility to take all your possessions without even suffering great losses. Once you are attacked, it is usually too late already."
step_4="The only strategy against this is to take many defensive precautionary measures, such as producing many spear- and swordsmen. You should not be an attractive and cheap target at the same time for these players. If they suffer a great loss in an attack, they will usually leave you alone. In this situation morale can can be a great help for you. The attacking troops could be weakened by up to 70%!"
step_5="This security phase will cost you time, but the defensive troops are not useless. They will help you a great deal in the future. If you have a good defence consisting of at least 1200 spearmen and 1200 swordmen, you can start creating a nobleman and putting together offensive troops."
step_6="You will probably be able to tell by the surrounding villages, that it was well worth it..."

moral="Morale"
moral_text="The purpose of the morale is to protect active small players from the attacks of very strong players. If a very strong player attacks a very weak player, his troops fight with a lower level of efficiency, because many of his warriors refuse to follow these dishonourable commands, or simply underestimate the strength of the enemy."
spy="Scout"
spy_text_1="The scouts' task is to gather information about your enemies' villages. They are produced in your stables. To spy on an enemy, attack him with any number of scouts. During battle the attacking scouts will try to gather information about the village. On the other hand the enemies' scouts will try to capture the attacking scouts. The higher the ratio between defending and attacking scouts, the more scouts will be captured."
spy_text_2="If the attacker has half as many scouts as the defender, the chances that scouts survive are about 50 %. But only very few scouts would survive. If the attacker has about the same amount of scouts, the chances that scouts survive are about 100% and about two thirds of the attacking scouts survive. The defender cannot loose any scouts."
spy_text_3="As long as at least one scout returns, you will receive a report about the strength of your enemie's army. This information will also be provided on any attack where at least 50% of the defending troops are killed."
spy_text_4="If at least 50% of the scouts survive, you get a report of your enemy's resources. If 70% of the scouts survive and the scouts have been skilled to at least level 2, you also get information about his buildings and the level they have been upgraded to. If 90% of the scouts survive and the scouts have been skilled to level 3, you get to find out how many units of the defending village are stationed in other villages or in transit."

A red bar means misfortune, a green bar represents luck. Maximum misfortune and maximum luck are both 25%t. That means that the troops of the attacker have become at most 25% weaker or stronger."
attacks_text_3="Further down you can find your troops involved in the battle and your losses. the attacker only receives a complete battle report if he had at least 50% of the fighting strength of the defending troops or if any scouts survived. Otherwise he only gets the message &quot;None of your troops have made it back home alive&quot;" without any information about the number of troops of the enemy.

[intro]
what="What is Tribal Wars"
tribalwars="Tribal Wars"
intro_1="<p>In the beginning of the game, it is important that you invest in your village and construct buildings. There are fifteen different building available. However, at the start of the game only seven of them are accessible for you. The others become available after you have constructed other buildings.</p><p>The construction of a building costs you a certain amount of resources (wood, iron and clay), which your lumberjacks, clay pit and iron mine produce, even when you are off-line. Besides these resources you also need villagers for the new building. You can add villagers by upgrading your farm to the next level. Upgrading buildings takes about twenty minutes in the beginning. But in the course of the game this construction time increases considerably.</p>"
intro_2="<p>New villages are also being established in your area of the map. They are controlled by other players. Communicating and cooperating with them is the basic idea behind &quot;Tribal Wars&quot;. Some of the other players will try to plunder you, others will engage in trade relations with you or support you. It is very important for you to get to know a lot of players quickly and to ally yourself with them by founding a tribe or becoming a member of an existing one. Your tribe will help to defend you, trade with you and teach you a lot of useful tricks.</p>"
intro_3="<p>The market place offers a good possibility to trade with other players with whom you have not yet communicated. You can accept other players' offers or post your own. This way you can acquire those resources that you need in exchange for those resources of which you currently have more than you need. Especially in the beginning this can save you valuable time.</p>"
intro_4="<p>Battles and wars play an important part in &quot;Tribal Wars&quot;. There are nine different types of units, each of them with different strenghts. They are recruited in the barracks, the stables and the workshop in exchange for resources and time. The battles take place in the villages. The units of the attacker are measured up against those of the defender. The aim of an attack can be to plunder resources, spy on the defender or simply zest for destruction. Ultimately the attacker might seek to take over the village.</p>"
