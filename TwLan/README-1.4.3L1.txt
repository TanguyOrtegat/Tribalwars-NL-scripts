TWLan / DSLan for Linux 1.4.3L1

== WHAT IS TWLAN / DSLAN ==
DSLan is the short form of "Die StÃ¤mme Local Area Network", the German version
of TribalWars. LAN means, that you are allowed to play DSLan only in your local
network. Playing DSLan with Hamachi is neither possible nor legal.


== INSTALLATION ==
Only one player has to download and install TWLan. All of the others should open
the IP address of the player running the server in their browser.

Before continuing, you have to know what a terminal is and where it can be
found. Within a terminal, you can enter commands to tell your computer what to
do. In Gnome (Ubuntu), the terminal can be found at
		Applications menu -> Accessories -> Terminal
In KDE (Kubuntu) the terminal can be found at
		KMenu -> System -> Terminal Program (Konsole)
(source: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal)

Download the installer from http://twlan.lekensteyn.nl/ and save it in your home
directory. Open an terminal and run the following command in it (you may be
prompted for your password):

	sudo sh ./twlan-1.4.3L1.sh

Replace twlan-1.4.3L1.sh by the actual name of the file you have just
downloaded if necessary. Follow the on-screen instructions.


== STARTING, PLAYING AND STOPPING TWLAN ==
Open a terminal an run:

	sudo /opt/twlan/twlan.sh start

You should see an IP address which you can open in your browser in order to play
TWLan. If not, run the following command:

	/opt/twlan/twlan.sh ip

Stopping TWLan goes in a similar way:

	sudo /opt/twlan/twlan.sh stop

If you don't know whether you have started TWLan or not, run:

	sudo /opt/twlan/twlan.sh status


== CONFIGURATION ==

processor like OpenOffice.org. The configuration file can be found in

/opt/twlan/htdocs/include/config.php

== ABOUT THIS PACKAGE ==
This package is slightly modified from the original 1.4 (3rd revision) DS LAN.
Changes (not related to htdocs):
- Startup / utilties script available as twlan.sh
- Added archers (extra rows in table unit_place: unit_(m)archer; table villages:
  unit_(m)archer_tec_level, all_unit_(m)archer)
- Added graphic package (extra rows in table users: css, image_base, gfx_old)
- SQL for an empty game available in extra/dslan.sql
- Events handler in extra/event.sh
- The server is a custom, compact build. That means it does not use XAMPP
  anymore, which was very large in size with lots of unused features.
- MySQL is not using port 3306 anymore
- MySQL is not generating errors about charsets anymore
- Apache is not using port 443 anymore
- Apache does not create an access log anymore, this will save disk space
- PHP has been hardened a little, adding a open_basedir restriction. Disabled
  magic_quotes globally, but enabling it for htdocs due to a incorrect
  implementation of escaping data. Note: exec and related functions have not
  been disabled.
Changes:
- Added a "Select all units" to place (templates/game_place_command.tpl and
  script.js)
